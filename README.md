<!-- Plugin description -->
The language support for D2, a modern language that turns text to diagrams.

The plugin is in active development. Don't hesitate to [file issues](https://github.com/develar/d2-intellij-plugin/issues).

The plugin is now compatible with JetBrains IDEs 2022.1 through 2022.3. However, version 2023.1 is not supported — please use version 2023.2 or later.

Please note that the plugin is being developed and tested for 2023.2 and higher, support for older versions may contain some bugs. As such, we advise against using older versions of the IDE.
